# Digit-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
The goal of this project is to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can automatically recognize and classify handwritten digits (0â€“9). The model will learn visual patterns in the pixel data and output the most likely digit for a given image.
